# Introduction #

The Onem16 kernel is a x86-16 kernel written in assembly code. The main objective is to be able to boot off of a USB drive and have enough basic features to be able to write programs on top of it. And running Sllide's space invaders clone ofcourse!


# The Name #
The name, Onem16 OS was originally One Man 16 bit OS, however since more than one person is working on the project, it has been changed to mean Obfuscated New Monolithic 16 Bit OS.
