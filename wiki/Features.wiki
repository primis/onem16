= Introduction =

This list will eventually be an interrupt table, but for the time being, its just gonna be a list of the features.


= Details =

Here is a short list of current features:
  * *getchar* - INPUT: Nothing. OUTPUT: Character in AL
     _Gets one character from stdin (no it doesn't have to be a keyboard!) and stores it in al for you._
  * *gets* - INPUT: Byte Array in SI. OUTPUT: Null Ended String in SI
    _Gets a null ended string from stdin, you point it an array in si, it returns a string in it, perfect for use with print_string._
  * *waitkey* - INPUT: Nothing. OUTPUT: Nothing
    _Waits for a keypress, then returns to program, doesn't return anything._
  * *print_string* - INPUT: Null Ended String in SI. OUTPUT: Nothing
    _Prints a string pointed to by si, stops at null ending, NOT newline._

= Upcoming Functions =
Some Upcoming functions to expect soon:
 * More printing stuff, like printing numbers.
 * Basic String Functions
 * Blind input for passwords and stuff
