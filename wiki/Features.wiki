= Introduction =

This list will eventually be an interrupt table, but for the time being, its just gonna be a list of the features.


= Details =

Here is a short list of current features:
  * getchar - Gets one character from stdin (no it doesn't have to be a keyboard!) and stores it in al for you.
  * gets - Gets a null ended string from stdin, you point it an array in si, it returns a string in it, perfect for use with print_string
  * waitkey - Waits for a keypress, doesn't return anything
  * print_string - prints a string pointed to by si, stops at null ending, NOT newline
